# Graphs-Automation
EDA Being one of the most important step it is also a very lengthy process. The creation of plots takes a decent amount of time. Automating the process of plotting the graphs could save a lot of time in the EDA process and reduce the effort of a data scientist significantly.The function that we have created should automate the process of plotting the graphs and save the resultant graphs as a png file in a specified directory. We must get a boxplot and a histogram for all columns with numeric values and a barplot for all columns with categorical values. The histogram and boxplot should be saved in one png file as subplots. If the directory is not specified then the plots must be saved in the current working directory
